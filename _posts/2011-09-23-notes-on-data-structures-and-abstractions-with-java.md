I use these notes to track thoughts I had, and things I found interesting, while reading _Data Structures & Abstractions with Java_

The notes are still in progress as I have not yet finished reading the book

## Introduction
- Abstract data types and data structures are contrasted in Wikipedia [as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) as "_an abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for data types, defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations. This mathematical model contrasts with data structures, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user_" and [as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) "_Data structures serve as the basis for abstract data types (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type_"

## 1. Bags
- A data type is defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) as "_a collection or grouping of data values, usually specified by a set of possible values, a set of allowed operations on these values, and/or a representation of these values as machine types_"
- According to the Java [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html), "_You cannot declare more than one method with the same name and the same number and type of arguments, because the compiler cannot tell them apart_"
- The book recommends writing code that uses and tests the interface before attempting to implement the interface
- Encapsulation is definied in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)) as "_the bundling of data with the mechanisms or methods that operate on the data_"
- The book recommends designing an abstract data type by only worrying about how the user will use it, and not about the implementation. There can be a tendency to let the underlying algorithms influence the interface, but this recommendation would resist that
