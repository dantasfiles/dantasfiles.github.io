I use these notes to track thoughts I had, and things I found interesting, while reading _Data Structures & Abstractions with Java_

The notes are still in progress as I have not yet finished reading the book

## Introduction
- Abstract data types and data structures are contrasted in Wikipedia [as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) as "_an abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for data types, defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations. This mathematical model contrasts with data structures, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user_" and [as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) "_Data structures serve as the basis for abstract data types (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type_"

## 1. Bags
- A data type is defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) as "_a collection or grouping of data values, usually specified by a set of possible values, a set of allowed operations on these values, and/or a representation of these values as machine types_"
