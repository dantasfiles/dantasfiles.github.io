title: "Teaching Assistant for üêØ <i>Compiling Techniques</i>"
description: "Understand the design and construction of compilers. Concepts include syntax analysis, semantics, code generation, optimization, and run-time systems. Problems in processing imperative languages, such as C and Pascal, as well as functional languages such as ML, will be examined. A complete compiler for a small language will be implemented in ML."

> Understand the design and construction of [compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler). Concepts include [syntax analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing#Computer_languages), [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Type_checking), [code generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_generation_(compiler)), [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimizing_compiler), and [run-time systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system). Problems in processing [imperative languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming), such as [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)), as well as [functional languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) such as [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)), will be examined. A complete compiler for a small language will be implemented in ML.
