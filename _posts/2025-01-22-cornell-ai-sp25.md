This is an unofficial list of books that are recommended in Spring 2025 courses for the **[artificial intelligence minor at Cornell](https://prod.cis.cornell.edu/undergraduate-opportunities/minors/artificial-intelligence/ai-minor-requirements)**\
The books marked with a ✨ are ones I’ve been interested enough in to read at length
