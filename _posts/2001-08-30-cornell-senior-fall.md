| **Independent Reading & Research** <br> COM S 490 | _[On the Need for System-Level Support for Ad-hoc & Sensor Networks](https://dantasfiles.com/2002/04/01/osr.html)_ published at ACM Operating Systems Review |
| **Intermediate Computer Systems** <br> COM S 514 | This course focuses on practical issues in designing & implementing distributed software. Recent offerings have covered object-oriented software development methodologies & tools, distributed computing, fault-tolerant systems, and network operating systems or databases. Students undertake a substantial software project |
| **Signals & Systems I** <br> ECE 301 | Covers: continuous-time signals & linear time-invariant systems, continuous-time convolution & impulse response, Fourier series & transforms of continuous-time signals, the Sampling Theorem, amplitude modulation & time- and frequency-division multiplexing, bilateral Laplace transforms & applications, and discrete-time convolution and z-transforms with applications to discrete-time linear time-invariant systems |
| **Electromagnetic Fields & Waves** <br> ECE 303 | Maxwell‚Äôs equations in differential form; wave equation; plane electromagnetic waves; phase & group velocities; Poynting‚Äôs theorem, complex dielectric constant; wave reflection & transmission; guided waves on transmission lines; transient pulse propagation; and elementary dipole antenna; analysis of wireless communication links |
