These are notes I made while reading _[Speech & Language Processing: An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics & Speech Recognition with Language Models](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)_

The notes are still in progress as I have not yet finished reading the book

## I. Fundamental Algorithms for NLP

### 2. Regular Expressions, Tokenization, Edit Distance
