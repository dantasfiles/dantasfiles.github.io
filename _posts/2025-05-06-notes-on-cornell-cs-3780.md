I was curious to learn what has been updated since I took a [version of CS 3780](https://dantasfiles.com/2001/01/22/cornell-junior-spring.html), so I am reading through the [lecture slides for the Spring 2025 semester](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3780/2025sp/)

I use these notes to keep track of my thoughts while reading and to record anything that sticks out to me as interesting. The notes are incomplete as I have not yet finished reading the slides

##  Introduction
- The slides contain a fun flowchart: _(training data + training output ‚Üí program / model) + test data ‚Üí test output_
- I've heard many definitions of machine learning and artificial intelligence, but the ones use by this course are machine learning: "_programs that improve with experience, a subfield of artificial intelligence_" and artificial intelligence: "_programs that demonstrate 'intelligence' in some sense_"
