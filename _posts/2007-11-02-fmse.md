> In defining large, complex [access control policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_access_control), one would like to compose sub-policies, perhaps authored by different organizations, into a single global policy. Existing policy composition approaches tend to be ad-hoc, and do not explain whether too many or too few policy combinators have been defined. We define an access control policy as a four-valued predicate that maps accesses to either grant, deny, conflict, or unspecified. These correspond to the four elements of the [Belnap bilattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-valued_logic#Belnap). Functions on this bilattice are then extended to policies to serve as policy combinators. We argue that this approach provides a simple and natural semantic framework for policy composition, with a minimal but functionally complete set of policy combinators. We define derived, higher-level operators that are convenient for the specification of access control policies, and enable the decoupling of conflict resolution from policy composition. Finally, we propose a basic [query language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language) and show that it can reduce important analyses (e.g., conflict analysis) to checks of policy refinement.
