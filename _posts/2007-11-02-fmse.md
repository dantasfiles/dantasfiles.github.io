title: "<i>A Simple & Expressive Semantic Framework for Policy Composition in Access Control</i> published at ACM Formal Methods in Security Engineering (FMSE)"
description: "In defining large, complex access control policies, one would like to compose sub-policies, perhaps authored by different organizations, into a single global policy. We define an access control policy as a four-valued predicate that maps accesses to either grant, deny, conflict, or unspecified."
