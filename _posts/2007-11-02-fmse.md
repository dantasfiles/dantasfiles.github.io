title: "<i>A Simple and Expressive Semantic Framework for Policy Composition in Access Control</i> published at ACM workshop on Formal Methods in Security Engineering: From Specifications to Code (FMSE)"
description: "In defining large, complex access control policies, one would like to compose sub-policies, perhaps authored by different organizations, into a single global policy. Existing policy composition approaches tend to be ad-hoc, and do not explain whether too many or too few policy combinators have been defined. We define an access controlpolicy as a four-valued predicate that maps accesses to either grant, deny, conflict, or unspecified."
