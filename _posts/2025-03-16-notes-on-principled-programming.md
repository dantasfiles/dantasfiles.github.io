These are things I found interesting while reading [Principled Programming: Introduction to Coding in Any Imperative Language](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/people/tt/Principled_Programming.html)

The notes are still in progress as I have not yet finished reading the book

## 1. Introduction
- The book advises writing it right the first time, not assuming it will be fixed later, and avoiding debugging as much as possible. This is something that I try to do, but I've noticed a lot of other people don't
- There's a great example on how to think methodically about code in this chapter

## 2. Prerequisites
