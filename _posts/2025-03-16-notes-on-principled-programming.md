These are things I found interesting while reading [Principled Programming: Introduction to Coding in Any Imperative Language](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/people/tt/Principled_Programming.html)

The notes are still in progress as I have not yet finished reading the book

## Preface
- The book is aimed at the level of a first computer class. However, it seems to fit better at a second class level, which is why it is a suggested resource in a second computer class, üêª[CS 2110](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2110/2025sp/resources.html)

## 1. Introduction
- The book advises writing it right the first time, not assuming it will be fixed later, and avoiding debugging as much as possible. This is something that I try to do, but I've noticed a lot of other people don't
- There's a great example on how to think methodically about code in this chapter

## 2. Prerequisites
- The book includes the program counter in the definition of _state_, then defines _effect_ as a change in state. This implies that stepping through the code is an effect, which is not how most people think about effects

## 3. Specifications & Implementations
- The book advises to think of specifications in two directions: inwards in defining what the implementation will do, and outwards in defining how the specification will be used by the rest of the program
- The book bemoans that specifications contained in comments are essential to programming but are not used by the compiler or other tools. Perhaps it's worth exploring ways to change that
- The book advises that specifications should detail what to do and why you did it (don't assume you'll remember anything later), not how to do it--requirements, not processes
- Information hiding is defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding) as "_the principle of segregation of the design decisions in a computer program that are most likely to change, thus protecting other parts of the program from extensive modification if the design decision is changed_"
- The book recommends that programs should explicitly complain when inputs violate preconditions, to avoid bugs where the user of the specification is unaware that bad inputs are being sent 
- State space is defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space_(computer_science)) as "_a discrete space representing the set of all possible configurations of a system_"
- A representation invariant is defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_invariant) as "_a set of invariant properties that remain uncompromised regardless of the state of the object_"

## 4. Stepwise Refinement
- Stepwise refinement / top-down approach is defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom-up_and_top-down_design) as "_an overview of the system is formulated, specifying, but not detailing, any first-level subsystems. Each subsystem is then refined in yet greater detail, sometimes in many additional subsystem levels, until the entire specification is reduced to base elements_"
- The book warn to be wary of a stepwise refinement situation where you've divided the problem into subproblems that may be harder to solve then the overall problem
- The book points out that a specification of going from a precondition to a postcondition, is satisfied by an implementation that goes from a weakened version of the precondition (a superset of states allowed by the precondition) to a stronger version of the postcondition (a subset of states required by the postcondition). This way of thinking about specifications is incredibly useful
- The book points out that one reason pulling code into a helper method is useful is that it is easy to tell which variables do not get passed to  the helper function, and thus are not accessed or changed by the helper function's functionality
- Loop variant is defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_variant) as "_a mathematical function defined on the state space of a computer program whose value is monotonically decreased with respect to a (strict) well-founded relation by the iteration of a while loop under some invariant conditions, thereby ensuring its **termination**_"
- Loop invariant is defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_invariant) as "_a property of a program loop that is true before (and after) each iteration...expressed by formal predicate logic and used to prove properties of loops and by extension algorithms that employ loops (usually **correctness** properties)_"
- The book advises that to determine a loop invariant, examine the postcondition and weaken it. For [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_invariant#Floyd%E2%80%93Hoare_logic), if {C^I} body {I}, then {I} while(C){body} {!C^I} where !C^I satisfies the postcondition you are trying to achieve. This is a great way to think about loop conditions and invariants
- The book divides code into types: sequential, case analysis (conditional statements), iterative (loops), recursive, and library of previously solved patterns. This is an interesting way of thinking about how to break down problems
- The book suggests coding a loop in the following order: body, termination, initialization, finalization, boundary conditions (first & last iteration). I've never consciously thought about the order--it may be worth trying in the future

## 5. Online Algorithms
- Online algorithm is defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm) as "_process its input piece-by-piece in a serial fashion, i.e., in the order that the input is fed to the algorithm, without having the entire input available from the start_". The keys are that you cannot store the input as it comes in, only update summary values, and you have to make decisions for each input without being able to look at the up-coming input.
- The book suggests that loop invariants are particularly visible, and crucial to specify correctly, in online algorithms

## 6. Enumeration Patterns
- Enumeration is defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumeration) as "_complete, ordered listing of all the items in a collection_"
- The book points out two commonly off-by-one errors: the index associated with the nth object is n-1, and the number of objects between index m and n is m-n+1
- The `BigInteger` class is described in the Java [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/24/docs/api/java.base/java/math/BigInteger.html) as "_immutable arbitrary-precision integers_"
- In the Python [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex), "_integers have unlimited precision_"
- The book presents a typical indeterminate enumeration: `while ( i <= maxi && condition )` then check at end if `i > maxi`
- The books recommends using `for` loops for determinate enumerations and `while` loops for indeterminate enumerations. This is often good advice--I've seen example code use `for` loops with `break` statements inside that are confusing. However, it means you have to use `Iterator`s instead of for-each loops for indeterminate enumerations, which seems less clean
- The book points out that to subtract 1 in arithmetic mod N, add N-1 to keep the result positive
- The book advises that if performing a potentially unnecessary harmless operation takes as long as checking to see whether it should be done, don't bother checking and just simplify the code by doing it. In general, the book advises using making the boundary case special code as small as possible--which seems a variant of the "premature optimization" advice. It's also not great on multi-dimensional arrays, which are presented akwardly later in the chapter
- The book advises against performing arithmetic on indices, which would seem to make the use of for-each loops preferable
- The `BitSet` class is described in the Java [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/24/docs/api/java.base/java/util/BitSet.html) as "_implements a vector of bits that grows as needed_" and may be preferable to using a simpler `boolean` array if space is an issue
- The difference between row- and column-major order is described in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order) as "_in row-major order, the consecutive elements of a row reside next to each other, whereas the same holds true for consecutive elements of a column in column-major order_
- The book describes picking two indices from a set as using the lower-triangular region ((2,1),(3,1),(3,2)...). I find it more natural to think of the upper-trangular region ((1,2),(1,3),(2,3)), but the former is easier to code
- Aleph-zero is defined in Wikipedia as "_‚Ñµ<sub>0</sub> (aleph-nought, aleph-zero, or aleph-null) is the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers, and is an infinite cardinal. The set of all finite ordinals, called œâ or œâ<sub>0</sub> (where œâ is the lowercase Greek letter omega), also has cardinality ‚Ñµ<sub>0</sub>. A set has cardinality ‚Ñµ<sub>0</sub> if and only if it is countably infinite, that is, there is a bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between it and the natural numbers_"

## 7. Sequential Search
- Linear / sequential search is defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search) as "_sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched_"
- Gestalt psychology, gestaltism, or configurationism is defined by Wikipedia as "_school of psychology and a theory of perception that emphasises the processing of entire patterns and configurations, and not merely individual components_"
- The book advises to develop an algorithm systematically, sticking in well-known patterns as you proceed, rather than relying on overall pattern intuition. This is because an algorithm cannot look at an entire array with intuition, but must look at it one step at a time
- The book implies that sometimes it's more natural to figure out when the loop should end, then negate that for use as the loop condition
- Sentinel value is defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_value) as "_special value in the context of an algorithm which uses its presence as a condition of termination, typically in a loop or recursive algorithm_"

## 8. Binary Search
- The book has a bit of fun with the idea that "looking up a word in the dictionary" is no longer a thing that people physically do
- Binary search is defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search) as "_compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array_"
- The book points out that a while loop consists of four parts, while a for loop consists of six parts
- The book's algorithm finds the leftmost instance of the key by searching left is the middle element is the key. This a stronger result then the specification of find-an-index, and an optimization of stopping if the middle element contains the key could have been used
- Sometimes indices like j, left, and right are inclusive and sometimes they are exclusive. The choice sometimes makes the algorithm easier or harder. Be very careful and document which is which to avoid off-by-one errors
- `java.util.Arrays.binarysearch` is described in the Java [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/24/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Arrays.html#binarySearch(java.lang.Object%5B%5D,java.lang.Object)) as "_Searches the specified array for the specified object using the binary search algorithm. The array must be sorted into ascending order according to the natural ordering of its elements (as by the `sort(Object[]) method)` prior to making this call... If the array contains multiple elements equal to the specified object, there is no guarantee which one will be found.... Returns: index of the search key, if it is contained in the array; otherwise, (-(insertion point) - 1). The insertion point is defined as the point at which the key would be inserted into the array: the index of the first element greater than the key, or a.length if all elements in the array are less than the specified key_"

## 9. One-Dimensional Array Rearrangements
- The book advises using left and right indices when reversing an array, to make it easier to code and understand. **The book advises against index arithmetic in general**. Then again, the next example uses index arithmetic so ü§∑
- Aliasing is defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing_(computing)) as "_data location in memory can be accessed through different symbolic names in the program_"
- The book advises that when trying to figure out something like a for loop limit, look at how it depends on variables x and y (positively or negatively), then write "x-y+constant" and try to figure out the constant
