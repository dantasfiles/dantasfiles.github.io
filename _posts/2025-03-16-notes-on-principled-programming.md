These are things I found interesting while reading [Principled Programming: Introduction to Coding in Any Imperative Language](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/people/tt/Principled_Programming.html)

The notes are still in progress as I have not yet finished reading the book

## Preface
- The book is aimed at the level of a first computer class. However, it seems to fit better at a second class level, which is why it is a suggested resource in Cornell's second computer class, [CS 2110](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2110/2025sp/resources.html)

## 1. Introduction
- The book advises writing it right the first time, not assuming it will be fixed later, and avoiding debugging as much as possible. This is something that I try to do, but I've noticed a lot of other people don't
- There's a great example on how to think methodically about code in this chapter

## 2. Prerequisites
- The book includes the program counter in the definition of _state_, then defines _effect_ as a change in state. This implies that stepping through the code is an effect, which is not how most people think about effects
- The book contrasts the definitions of the _scope_ of a name of a variable, and the _lifetime_ of a variable. In practice, these two are used interchangeably
