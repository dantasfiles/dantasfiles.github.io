description: "We have developed a new aspect-oriented programming language, AspectML, that allows programmers to control information hiding and access to the internals of a module through a simple static type system. Using our mechanisms, programmers can prevent aspects from interfering with local invariants or reading information that should be kept private to a module."

## [ðŸ“„Preprint](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/research/techreps/391)

> [Aspect-oriented programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming) such as [AspectJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AspectJ) provide a new way to separate out and consolidate code for debugging, profiling, distribution and other tasks that would otherwise become tangled with the main-line computation. Without aspects, this code can be difficult to understand and maintain. Unfortunately, while aspects purport to provide a new form of [modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity), they also defeat the purpose of existing [information hiding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding) and modularity mechanisms.

> We have developed a new aspect-oriented programming language, AspectML, that allows programmers to control information hiding and access to the internals of a module through a simple [static type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking). Using our mechanisms, programmers can prevent aspects from interfering with local invariants or reading information that should be kept private to a module. Consequently, AspectML is the first aspect-oriented language that interoperates safely and effectively with rich module systems.
