| :---: | --- |
| **Intro. to Theory of Computing** <br> COM S 381 | An introduction to the modern theory of computing: automata theory, formal languages & effective computability
| **Systems Programming & Operating Systems** <br> COM S 414 | An introduction to the logical design of systems programs, with emphasis on multiprogrammed operating systems. Topics include process synchronization, deadlock, memory management, input-output methods, information sharing, protection & security, and file systems. The impact of network & distributed computing environments on operating systems is also discussed.
| **Practicum in Operating Systems** <br> COM S 415 | The practical aspects of operating systems are studied through the' design & implementation of an operating system kernel that supports multiprogramming, virtual memory & various input-output devices. All the programming for the project is in a high-level language |
| **Computer Architecture** <br> ELE E 475 | Topics include instruction set principles, advanced pipelining, data & control hazards, multi-cycle instructions, dynamic scheduling, out-of-order execution, speculation branch prediction, instruction-level parallelism, and high-performance memory hierarchies. Students will learn the issues & tradeoffs involved in the design of modern microprocessors |
| **Basic Engineering Probability & Statistics** <br> ENGRD 270 | This course should give students a working knowledge of basic probability & statistics and their application to engineering. Computer analysis of data & simulation are included. Topics include random variables, probability distributions, expectation, estimation, testing, experimental design, quality control & regression |
