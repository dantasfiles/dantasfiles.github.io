title: Choosing Medium as a blogging platform

While I created a MedTech IoT project, I wanted to write guides about AWS cloud issues I was solving, like the following:

**[Multi-Tenant AWS Amplify](https://medium.com/@dantasfiles/multi-tenant-aws-amplify-cc3252c4def4)**
> In this series of posts, we explore three methods for creating multi-tenant AWS Amplify mobile apps in React Native

In the past, I had a personal site created with [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) at dantasfiles.com. I mostly used it to publicize [research results](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kGsoFNQAAAAJ).

But Wordpress was overkill for the static pages that I was creating. I was also unsure whether I was complying with the [specifications](https://developers.google.com/search/docs) that websites must satisfy these days to ensure visibility and discoverability on search indices. Finally, I was concerned that if I attempted to enable new features by changing settings and experimenting with plugins, I could open up a vulnerability on my site.

So, much like my decision not to run a personal email server, I decided to place my technical guides on a third-party blogging site. I examined the popularity of several sites using [Amazon’s Alexa web traffic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Internet). I could post on a site that was well-visited but not dedicated to technology, like Medium, or on a less-visited, specialty technology site like [DEV](https://dev.to/). 

Both had similar editing tools, and I didn’t have much preference there. There were plenty of technology articles on Medium, so anything I posted wouldn’t be out of place there.

I decided to go with the well-visited, not dedicated to technology site, to get as much reach as possible, and chose Medium.
