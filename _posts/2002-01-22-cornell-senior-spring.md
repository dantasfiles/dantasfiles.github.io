| :---: | --- |
| **Independent Reading & Research** <br> COM S 490 | _[On the Need for System-Level Support for Ad-hoc & Sensor Networks](https://dantasfiles.com/2002/04/01/osr.html)_ published at ACM Operating Systems Review |
| **Computer Networks** <br> COM S 519 | Introduction to computer networks with an emphasis on evolving Internet standards. Detailed introduction to networking protocols for reliable data transfer, flow control, congestion control, naming & addressing, routing, error control, and multiple access. Fundamentals of layered protocols & techniques for protocol design & implementation.
| **Digital Systems Design Laboratory** <br> ECE 232 | An introduction to digital systems design using computer-aided design (CAD) tools. Students complete a sequence of eight experiments covering combinational logic, sequential circuits, counters, data transfer & microcontroller design. Hands-on experience is provided by designing, implementing & testing an 8 bit microcontroller using a field programmable gate array (FPGA) |
| **Engineering Communications** <br> ENGRC 350 | Engineering graduates spend much of their time conveying technical information to a variety of audiences. They write a range of documents, give oral presentations & use visuals to enhance their writing & talks. This course draws on material from professional settings to help students develop effective processes for drafting, editing & revising documents; communicating specialized information in different contexts; working in teams; and addressing relevant organizational & ethical issues. Students learn to communicate effectively through diverse assignments & a longer term project of their choice (for example, a research paper, feasibility study, or users’ manual) |
