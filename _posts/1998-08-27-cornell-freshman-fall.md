| **Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs**<br>COM S 212 | A challenging introduction to programming languages & computer science that emphasizes alternative modes of algorithmic expression. Topics include recursive & higher-order procedures, performance analysis of algorithms, proofs of program correctness, probabilistic algorithms, symbolic hierarchical data, abstract data types, polymorphic functions, object-oriented programming, infinite data types, simulation & the interpretation of programs |
| **Calculus for Engineers**<br>MATH 192 | Methods of integration, polar coordinates, complex numbers, infinite series. Introduction to physical vectors & calculus of functions of several variables
| **Physics I: Mechanics**<br>PHYS 112 | Mechanics of particles: kinematics, dynamics, conservation laws, central force fields, periodic motion. Mechanics of many-particle systems: center of mass, rotational mechanics of a rigid body, static equilibrium |
| **American Literature & Culture**<br>ENGL 158 | First-year writing seminar |
