| **Programming Languages** <br> COS 510 | Logic and formal reasoning about software, treating programs and programming languages as mathematical objects about which precise claims can be made. Basic concepts and techniques such as operational semantics and axiomatic semantics for specifying programming languages; structure, definition and properties of type systems; invariants and assertions for specifying programs. Use of automated tools such as interactive proof assistants, model checkers, and/or satisfiability-modulo-theories solvers
| **Advanced Operating Systems** <br> COS 518) | Survey of operating systems covering: early systems, virtual memory, protection, synchronization, process management, scheduling, input/output, file systems, virtual machines, performance analysis, software engineering, user interfaces, distributed systems, networks, current operating systems, case studies. Survey of research papers from classic literature through contemporary research. |
