The books and other media are sorted in reverse chronological order. The ones I found particularly interesting are marked with a ‚ú®

- [*Godel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) by Douglas Hofstadter
  - Really enjoyed the clever mathematical dialogues between the imaginary characters. Did not enjoy the author reinventing their own idiosyncratic terminology for well-known computer science topics, instead of using existing terminology and allowing the reader to fit the book into the greater context of the field
- *Quantum Supremacy: How the Quantum Computer Revolution Will Change Everything* by Michio Kaku
  - This book was written for a very general audience, and contained very little on how quantum computers work
- ***God, Human, Animal, Machine: Technology, Metaphor, and the Search for Meaning***‚ú® by Meghan O'Gieblyn
  - A lot of writing about AI is religious in tone, and I appreciated how this book was up-front about its intentions
- [*Number Go Up: Inside Crypto's Wild Rise and Staggering Fall*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Go_Up) by Zeke Faux
- ***Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems***‚ú® by Martin Kleppman 
- [*Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_War:_The_Fight_for_the_World%27s_Most_Critical_Technology) by Chris Miller
  - Particularly enjoyed the sections about the ASML corporation
- *The Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the 21 Century's Greatest Dilemma* by Mustafa Suleyman
  - Too general and speculative for my tastes, would have preferred concrete examples and historical analogues
- [*Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_Infinite) by Michael Lewis
  - Michael Lewis likes his protagonist, and it comes across in his writing.
- [*Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Compatible) by Stuart Russell
- ***AI 2041: Ten Visions for Our Future*** by Kai-Fu Lee & Chen Qiufan ‚ú®
  - Using science fiction stories as framing was a really fun choice. The almost-self-driving-car short story was my personal favorite.
- *The Age of AI and Our Human Future* by Kissinger, Schmidt & Huttenlocher
  - Too general and speculative for my tastes, would have preferred concrete examples and historical analogues
- [***What Is ChatGPT Doing ... and Why Does It Work?***](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/) by Stephen Wolfram ‚ú®
  - A really well presented explanation of LLMs
- [*Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_3.0) by Max Tegmark
  - Too general and speculative for my tastes, would have preferred concrete examples and historical analogues
- [*Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies) by Nick Bostrom
  - Way too assertive about engineering and economic impacts that are highly speculative. Found the style very offputting to my STEM background
- *Artificial Intelligence: The Past, Present and Future of Machines that Think* by New Scientist
- [*AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_Superpowers) by Kai-Fu Lee
- *Consciousness: Understanding the Ghost in the Machine* by New Scientist
  - The tl;dr of most of the articles in this edition of New Scientist were "ü§∑" which I appreciate the honesty
- [***Cosmos: Possible Worlds***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_Possible_Worlds)‚ú® by National Geographic
- [*Nova: Computers v. Crime*](https://www.pbs.org/video/computers-v-crime-um7cco/) by PBS
- [*Unknown: Killer Robots*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown:_Killer_Robots) by Netflix
  - Seemed too much like an advertisement for the companies showcased in this documentary
- [*Responsible and Open Foundation Models*](https://sites.google.com/view/open-foundation-models) by Princeton	
- *Atlas Obscura: An Explorer's Guide to the World's Hidden Wonders* by Foer, Thuras & Morton
