title: "Resize LibreViewâ€™s Daily Logs PDF for easier reading & printing"
# description: "Patched an existing tool, iccir919.github.io/fitbit-json-to-csv, to fix two issues"

tldr: The tool is located at https://dantasfiles.com/resize-libreview-daily-logs-pdf/ and the source code at [GitHub: Resize LibreView Daily Logs PDF](https://github.com/dantasfiles/resize-libreview-daily-logs-pdf)

A friend wears a FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitor.

The glucose levels are uploaded to the LibreView site, where they can be converted to a pdf file and printed. Then you can take the printouts to your doctor.

The reason the friend asked for help is that the LibreView site seems to have an issue, where the daily logs are created in a landscape-like format, but the pdf file is in portrait format. As a result, the text is very small, and much of the page is wasted

I created a tool at https://dantasfiles.com/resize-libreview-daily-logs-pdf/ that takes the pdf file with the daily logs and make it more legible when printed. The source code is at [GitHub: Resize LibreView Daily Logs PDF](https://github.com/dantasfiles/resize-libreview-daily-logs-pdf)

The resulting output.pdf file looks like this.
