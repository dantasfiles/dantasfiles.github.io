These are thoughts I had, and things I found interesting, while reading [Object-Oriented Design and Data Structures](https://andrewcmyers.github.io/oodds/)

The notes are still in progress as I have not yet finished reading the book

## 1. Introduction
- The book starts off with the great observation: "_One of the joys of working with computers is that it is relatively easy to create new things...The constraints of the real world weigh much less heavily on software developers than on engineers in other disciplines_." This is often expressed in technology social media as "_you can just do things_"

## 2. Values, Types, and Variables
- There are [different definitions of a strongly-typed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing), but the one used in this book is "_run-time type errors are not possible_." Wikipedia points to an [article by Luca Cardelli](http://www.lucacardelli.name/Papers/TypefulProg.pdf) with a similar definition: "_the absence of unchecked run-time type errors_"
- The book points out that Java, unlike Python, is whitespace-insensitive, but, in practice, everyone uses it in a whitespace-sensitive manner, with line breaks and indenting, for readability.
