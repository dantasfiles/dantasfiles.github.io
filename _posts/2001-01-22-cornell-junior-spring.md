| **Intro. to Compilers & Translators** <br> COM S 412 | An introduction to the specification & implementation of modern compilers. Topics covered include lexical scanning, parsing, type checking, code generation & translation, an introduction to optimization, and the implementation of modern programming languages |
| **Practicum in Compilers & Translators** <br> COM S 413 | A compiler implementation project |
| **Machine Learning** <br> COM S 478 - **[üåÜmy final project](https://github.com/dantasfiles/CatiMidi)** | This course presents an introduction to machine learning, the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. Topics to be covered will include some or all of the following: concept learning, decision tree learning, propositional & first-order rule learning, bayesian learning, instance-based learning, analytical learning, genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, computational learning theory, and methods for empirical evaluation of learning algorithms |
| **Intro. to Analysis of Algorithms** <br> COM S 482 | Techniques used in the creation & analysis of algorithms. Combinatorial algorithms, computational complexity, NP-completeness & intractable problems |
| **Applicable Algebra** <br> MATH 336 | An introduction to the concepts and methods of abstract algebra and number theory that are of interest in applications. Basic theory of groups, rings and fields and their applications to such areas as public-key cryptography, error-correcting codes, parallel computing, and experimental designs. Elementary number theory, Euclidean algorithm, prime factorization, congruences, theorems of Fermat and Euler, elementary group theory, Chinese remainder theorem, factorization in the ring of polynomials, classification of finite fields. Applications include the RSA cryptosystem and use of finite fields to construct error correcting codes and Latin squares |
