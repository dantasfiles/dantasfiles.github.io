> [NDSEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoD_NDSEG_Fellowship) is a [Department of Defense (DoD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense) fellowship program that funds graduate students to improve our nation's science and engineering education. The program is co-sponsored by [AFOSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Research_Laboratory), the Army Research Office (ARO), the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and the High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP)...

> In its history with the program, AFOSR has supported many talented student researchers in a wide range of fields...

> AFOSR selected Dr. Daniel Dantas as an NDSEG Fellow in computer science.

> Dr. Dantas' research focused on using [aspect-oriented programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming) for [computer security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security).

> Dantas specifically looked at what features a programming language would need to ease the implementation of security features in an aspect-oriented style. They also investigated how those features could affect the rest of a system...

> By funding research programs like the NDSEG Fellowship, AFOSR continues to support graduate education, train personnel to conduct high-quality research, and stimulate mutual research interests between the [Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force) and colleges and universities.
