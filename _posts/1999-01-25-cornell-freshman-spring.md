| **Discrete Structures**<br>COM S 280 | Covers mathematical aspects of programming and computing. Topics will be chosen from the following: mathematical induction; logical proof; propositional and predicate calculus; combinatorics and discrete mathematics covering manipulation of sums, recurrence relations, and generating-function techniques; basic number theory; sets, functions, and relations; partially ordered sets; graphs, and algebraic structures |
| **Engineering Mathematics**<br>MATH 293 | Introduction to ordinary differential equations, systems of ordinary linear differential equations. Vector fields and vector calculus. May include computer use in problem solving |
| **Physics II: Heat & Electromagnetism**<br>PHYS 213 | Temperature, heat, thermal energy, electrostatics, behavior of matter in electric fields, DC circuits, magnetic fields, Faraday’s law, Maxwell’s equations, electromagnetic oscillations. Laboratory covers electrical measurements, circuits, and some aspects of heat transfer |
| **Design Integration: A Portable CD Player**<br>MS&E / T&AM / ENGRI 118 | This course examines the roles of various engineering disciplines on the design of a portable compact disc (CD) player. Students are introduced to elements of mechanical, electrical, materials, environmental, manufacturing, and computer engineering as related to the CD player. Laboratory sessions and demonstrations are used to illustrate the principles of design |
