> This paper develops a simple object calculus with harmless [aspect-oriented advice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming). A piece of harmless advice is a computation that, like ordinary aspect-oriented advice, executes when control reaches a designated control-flow point. However, unlike ordinary advice, harmless advice is designed to obey a weak [non-interference property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interference_(security)). Harmless advice may change the termination behavior of computations and use I/O, but it does not otherwise influence the final result of computations that trigger it. A simple [type and effect system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system) related to [information-flow type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_flow_(information_theory)#Security_type_system) helps enforce harmlessness. We have proven that harmless advice does not interfere with the mainline computation.
