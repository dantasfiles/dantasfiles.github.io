> An introduction to [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) in the context of scientific, engineering, and commercial applications. The goal of the course is to teach basic principles and practical issues, while at the same time preparing students to use computers effectively for applications in computer science, physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, and other disciplines. Topics include: programming in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)); hardware and software systems; algorithms and data structures; fundamental principles of [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation); and [scientific computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_science), including [simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation), optimization, and data analysis.
