## [ðŸ“„Preprint](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/research/techreps/414)

> We take one of the first steps towards developing a practical, [statically-typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_typing), [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), [aspect-oriented programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming) by showing how to integrate [polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)) and type analysis with aspect-oriented programming features. In particular, we demonstrate how to define type-safe polymorphic advice using pointcuts that unify a collection of polymorphic join points. We also introduce a new mechanism for specifying context-sensitive advice that involves pattern matching against the current stack of activation records, and meshes well with functional programming idioms. We give our language meaning via type-directed translation into an expressive, but fairly simple, type-safe intermediate language. Many complexities of the source language are eliminated in this translation, leading to a modular specification of its semantics. One of the novelties of the intermediate language is the definition of polymorphic labels for marking control-flow points. These labels are organized in a tree structure such that a parent in the tree serves as a representative for the collection of all its children. Type safety requires that the type of each child is a generic instance of the type of the polymorphic parent. Similarly, when a set of labels is assembled as a pointcut, the type of each label is an instance of the type of the pointcut.
