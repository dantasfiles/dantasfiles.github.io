I was curious to learn what has been updated since I took a [version of CS 4820](https://dantasfiles.com/2001/01/22/cornell-junior-spring.html), so I am reading through the [lecture slides for the Spring 2025 semester](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4820/2025sp/)

I use these notes to keep track of my thoughts while reading and to record anything that sticks out to me as interesting. The notes are incomplete as I have not yet finished reading the slides
