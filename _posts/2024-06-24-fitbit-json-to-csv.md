A friend asked for help converting fitbit `json` files to `csv` format.

There was an [existing tool](https://iccir919.github.io/fitbit-json-to-csv/) but it no longer worked.

I patched the two issues, created two pull requests ([Json2csv@4.5.4](https://github.com/iccir919/fitbit-json-to-csv/pull/1) and [off-by-one issue on merge](https://github.com/iccir919/fitbit-json-to-csv/pull/2)) on the original repository, and hosted the [fixed tool on my website](https://dantasfiles.com/fitbit-json-to-csv/) until the pull requests are accepted
