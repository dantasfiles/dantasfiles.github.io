  - I was hazy on a lot of the linear algebra that I had learned in `MATH 2210` at Cornell, and this was a well-written refresher
- ✨ ***Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware Software Interface*** by David A. Patterson & John L. Hennessy ✨ 
  - I had read segments of the MIPS architecture edition of this book a long time ago. It was interesting to read about the new RISC-V architecture. Less had changed since I read a previous edition  than I had expected.
- ***The Risk-Driven Business Model: Four Questions That Will Define Your Company*** by Karan Girotra
  - Read because I was attending a talk by Prof. Girotra, and wanted to learn about his research
