📺 Nova: _[A.I. Revolution](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/ai-revolution/)_ <!-- 2/20/2025 -->
- Watching the host explore and struggle with his new artificial arm was a great illustration of how humans interact with machine learning systems. The episode contained a good non-technical explanation of generative AI for images

📺 Nova: [*Secrets in Your Data*](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/secrets-in-your-data/) by PBS <!-- 2/16/2025 -->
- A lot of privacy episodes are pretty bad, but this one was interesting because the host had a real curiousity about the subject and was there to explore and think, not to harangue

🗒️ [Lecture slides](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2024fa/) for 🐻*Intro. to Computing: A Design & Development Perspective* <!-- 2/4/2025 --> (**[🌆my notes](https://dantasfiles.com/2024/12/06/notes-on-cornell-cs-1110.html)**)
- When I [took a version of this course](https://dantasfiles.com/1998/06/29/cornell-prefreshman-summer.html), it used Java, but now it uses Python. It's interesting to see how the course adapts to the language choice
