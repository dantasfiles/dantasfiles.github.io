| **[Theory of Computation](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall03/cos487)** <br> COS 487 | Studies the limits of computation by identifying tasks that are either inherently impossible to compute, or impossible to compute within the resources available. Introduces students to computability & decidability, Godel's incompleteness theorem, computational complexity, NP-completeness, and other notions of intractability. This course also surveys the status of the P versus NP question. Additional topics may include: interactive proofs, hardness of computing approximate solutions, cryptography & quantum computation |
